# 📘 Student Attendance Management System  
**Database Management Systems Lab Project**

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Student Attendance Management System** is a database-driven application designed to manage, store, and track student attendance efficiently. The system reduces manual effort, minimizes errors, and provides quick access to attendance records for students and faculty. This project demonstrates the practical application of database design concepts learned in the DBMS lab.
